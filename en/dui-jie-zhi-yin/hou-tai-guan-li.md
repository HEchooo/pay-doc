You can periodically check the token balance in your account. Every 48 hours, the settlement will be automatically processed in the form of USDT tokens to the designated receiving account on the Tron network that you have set up. (Please note that the settlement of USDT and USDC on all networks will be converted to USDT on the Tron network at a 1:1 exchange rate for the settlement.)
